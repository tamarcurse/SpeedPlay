# SpeedPlay
SpeedPlay is a Java-based project designed to run a competitive quiz game across multiple computers.
In each round, all players receive the same question simultaneously,
and the first player to answer correctly earns points.
The project utilizes multiple processes, locks, and semaphores to manage synchronization and concurrency.
SpeedPlay was submitted as part of the Ministry of Education's curriculum and received a perfect score of 100.
